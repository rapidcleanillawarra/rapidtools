# feat(workshop): Add workshop job creation with mobile photo capture

This commit introduces a comprehensive workshop job management system with mobile-friendly photo capture capabilities, enabling field technicians to create job records with equipment details, customer information, and visual documentation.

## Files Modified:

### 1. `src/lib/Header.svelte`
- **ADDED**: Workshop navigation link in desktop and mobile menus
- **CHANGES**: 
  - Desktop: Added direct link after Pro Max dropdown
  - Mobile: Added link in mobile menu after Pro Max section
- **WHY**: Provide easy access to workshop functionality from main navigation
- **IMPACT**: Users can now access workshop features from any page
- **DIFF**:
```diff
+ <!-- Workshop Link -->
+ <a href="{base}/workshop/create" class="text-white text-lg font-medium hover:text-yellow-400 transition px-2 py-1">Workshop</a>

+ <!-- Mobile Workshop Link -->
+ <a href="{base}/workshop/create" class="block text-white text-base font-medium hover:text-yellow-400 transition px-3 py-2">Workshop</a>
```

## Files Created:

### 1. `src/routes/(protected)/workshop/create/+page.svelte`
- **PURPOSE**: Create new workshop jobs with comprehensive equipment and customer data collection
- **KEY FEATURES**:
  - Machine Information form (location, product details, fault description)
  - User Information form (customer details, contact info)
  - Dynamic optional contacts management (add/remove multiple contacts)
  - Mobile-friendly photo capture and upload
  - Responsive grid layouts for desktop/mobile
- **USAGE**: Navigate to `/workshop/create` to create new workshop jobs
- **FORM FIELDS**:
  - Location of Repair: Site/Workshop radio selection
  - Product Name, Client's Work Order, Make/Model, Serial Number
  - Site/Location, Fault Description (textarea)
  - Customer Name (Maropost), Contact Email, Contact Number
  - Optional Contacts: Name, Number, Email (dynamic table)
  - Photos: Take photo (camera) or upload from device
- **ACCESSIBILITY**: All form labels properly associated with controls using `for` attributes
- **MOBILE OPTIMIZATION**: 
  - Responsive grid layouts (1 column mobile, 2 columns desktop)
  - Touch-friendly buttons and inputs
  - Camera capture with `capture="environment"` for rear camera

### 2. `src/routes/(protected)/workshop/camera/+page.svelte`
- **PURPOSE**: Dedicated photo capture interface for workshop documentation
- **KEY FEATURES**:
  - Auto-opening modal prompt on page load
  - Camera capture with environment (rear camera) preference
  - Multiple photo upload support
  - Responsive photo grid with preview thumbnails
  - Individual photo removal with cleanup
  - Memory leak prevention with URL.revokeObjectURL()
- **USAGE**: Navigate to `/workshop/camera` for focused photo capture workflow
- **MOBILE FEATURES**:
  - Modal-first design for immediate action
  - Grid layout: 3 cols mobile, 4 cols small screens, 6 cols desktop
  - Touch-optimized remove buttons with hover states

## Technical Improvements:

### Form Accessibility
- **BEFORE**: Labels without proper associations (accessibility warnings)
- **AFTER**: All labels use `for` attributes linking to input `id`s
- **IMPACT**: Screen readers can properly navigate and announce form fields

### Photo Management
- **IMPLEMENTATION**: 
  - File validation (image types only)
  - Object URL creation for previews
  - Proper cleanup on component destroy
  - Multiple file selection support
- **SECURITY**: File type validation prevents non-image uploads
- **PERFORMANCE**: Efficient memory management with URL cleanup

### Responsive Design
- **MOBILE-FIRST**: Forms adapt from single column to multi-column layouts
- **TOUCH-FRIENDLY**: Appropriate button sizes and spacing for mobile interaction
- **CAMERA INTEGRATION**: Uses `capture="environment"` for optimal mobile camera experience

## Code Structure:

### TypeScript Interfaces
```typescript
type LocationType = 'Site' | 'Workshop';
type Contact = { name: string; number: string; email: string };
type PhotoItem = { file: File; url: string };
```

### Key Functions
- `addOptionalContact()`: Manages dynamic contact list
- `removeOptionalContact(index)`: Removes contact by index
- `addFiles(fileList)`: Processes selected images
- `removePhoto(index)`: Removes photo with URL cleanup

## Endpoints Modified:
- **Navigation**: Added `/workshop/create` and `/workshop/camera` routes
- **Protected Routes**: Both pages inherit authentication from `(protected)` layout

## Testing Instructions:

### Desktop Testing:
1. Navigate to any page and verify "Workshop" appears in header navigation
2. Click "Workshop" → should redirect to `/workshop/create`
3. Fill out form fields and verify validation
4. Test "Add" button for optional contacts
5. Test photo upload and removal

### Mobile Testing:
1. Open hamburger menu → verify "Workshop" link appears
2. Navigate to `/workshop/camera` → modal should auto-appear
3. Test "Take Photo" → should open camera with rear camera preference
4. Test "Upload from Device" → should open file picker
5. Verify photo grid responsive layout
6. Test photo removal functionality

### Accessibility Testing:
```bash
# Run linter to verify accessibility compliance
npm run lint
```

### Photo Functionality Testing:
- Upload multiple images simultaneously
- Verify image-only file filtering
- Test photo removal and memory cleanup
- Confirm responsive grid layouts across screen sizes

## Breaking Changes:
- None

## Dependencies:
- No new dependencies added
- Uses existing Svelte transitions and lifecycle functions

## Deployment Requirements:
- Standard SvelteKit build process
- No additional server configuration needed
- Protected routes require existing authentication system
