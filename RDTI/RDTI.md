## 2. PROJECT OVERVIEW

**Technology Stack** (applies to all tools)
*   Svelte â€“ Front-end user interface layer
*   Microsoft Power Automate â€“ API connection to Maropost API and workflow orchestration
*   Neto / Maropost API â€“ Data fetch & update for products, prices, and orders
*   GitHub â€“ Repository for version control
*   GitHub Pages â€“ Production deployment and CI/CD pipeline

### 2.1 Product Creation Tool (PCT)
**Objective:** Automate end to end SKU request and validation for up to 100 items, reducing quotation prep time by ~80% and eliminating manual errors.
**Customer Outcome:** Accurate, same day quotes with correct pricing, brand, and supplier information.
**Why Custom:** Off the shelf CPQ/CRM tools lacked native real time SKU existence checks and multi supplier support under <2â€¯s latency.

### 2.2 Gross Profit Margin Tool (GPM)
**Objective:** Real time margin calculations with sub 500â€¯ms updates, enabling optimized pricing across multi supplier orders.
**Customer Outcome:** Transparent, margin consistent quotes with target thresholds of 20% gross profit.
**Why Custom:** ERP modules lacked dynamic RRP lookups, client side caching, and color coded threshold feedback.

### 2.3 Product Price Update Tool (PPU)
**Objective:** Bulk price management with bi directional calculations and smart batching to handle API rate limits.
**Customer Outcome:** Consistent, accurate pricing across channels with dramatic admin time savings.
**Why Custom:** PIM solutions couldn't perform real time, partial update calculations or handle undocumented API limits.

### 2.4 Product Request Approval Tool (PRA)
**Objective:** Integrated validation and approval workflow with Firebase Maropost hybrid validation to cut product creation lifecycle from days to minutes.
**Customer Outcome:** Rapid, vetted product requests with full audit trails and category mapping.
**Why Custom:** PLM systems lacked combined Firebase and Maropost integration and bespoke validation rules.

## 4. SUPPORTING R&D ACTIVITIES

The core R&D activities detailed above were supported by a range of activities essential for the conduct of the experiments and the generation of new knowledge. These supporting activities included:

**4.1 Technical Literature Review and Feasibility Analysis:**
*   Systematic review of Maropost API documentation, including undocumented features and limitations relevant to batch processing (PCT, PPU), real-time data synchronization (GPM), and integration capabilities (PRA), particularly in conjunction with Power Automate.
*   Investigation into Svelte framework capabilities for building responsive and high-performance user interfaces for the tools.
*   Research into client-side caching strategies, LRU eviction policies, and data prefetching techniques to achieve sub-500ms response times for the GPM tool, implemented within the Svelte front-end.
*   Research into smart batching algorithms and exponential backoff mechanisms to manage API rate limits effectively for the PPU tool, orchestrated via Power Automate.
*   Analysis of hybrid client-server validation approaches and cross-platform data exchange patterns for integrating Firebase with Maropost in the PRA tool, considering Svelte for the client-side and Power Automate for server-side/Maropost interactions.
*   Evaluation of GitHub Pages and GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipeline automation, deployment strategies, and version control best practices in the context of the experimental objectives for each tool.

**4.2 R&D Project Planning and Process Management:**
*   Defining detailed experimental plans, hypotheses, and methodologies for each R&D project (PCT, GPM, PPU, PRA), including the establishment of quantitative metrics and pass/fail criteria documented in Section 3.
*   Iterative refinement of development approaches based on experimental outcomes and technical challenges encountered during the development of the four tools.
*   Maintaining systematic records of experimental iterations, code changes (via Git commits), and results to track the progression of new knowledge and support R&D claims.

**4.3 Specialized R&D Environment Configuration and Maintenance:**
*   Establishment and configuration of dedicated development and testing environments using Svelte, Power Automate, and GitHub (including GitHub Pages for staging/testing deployments) to conduct experiments for PCT, GPM, PPU, and PRA.
*   Management of API keys, authentication protocols (for Maropost, Firebase), and simulated data sets to facilitate controlled experimentation and validation of the novel features developed with Svelte and Power Automate.
*   Implementation of version control (Git via GitHub) protocols and practices, including branching strategies and pull request reviews, tailored to tracking experimental changes and iterations across the R&D projects.
*   Configuration of CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions for automated building, testing, and deployment of Svelte applications to GitHub Pages.

**4.4 Supportive Data Collection and Analysis for Experimental Iterations:**
*   Development of specific procedures for collecting and logging performance metrics (e.g., API response times, UI rendering speeds, validation accuracy) during the experimental phases of PCT, GPM, PPU, and PRA.
*   Analysis of the collected data to validate hypotheses, assess the efficacy of different technical approaches (e.g., parallel API calls, caching strategies), and guide further experimental development.
