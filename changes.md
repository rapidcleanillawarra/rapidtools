# feat(workshop): Add comprehensive workshop job status management

This commit introduces a new Workshop Job Status page that provides a comprehensive view of all workshop jobs with advanced filtering, sorting, and management capabilities.

### Files Created:

#### 1. `src/routes/(protected)/workshop/job-status/+page.svelte`
- **Purpose**: Provides workshop managers with a centralized view to monitor and manage all workshop jobs
- **Key Features**:
  - Comprehensive table displaying all workshop jobs with key information
  - Advanced filtering by status (pending, in_progress, completed, cancelled) and customer name
  - Interactive column sorting with visual indicators
  - Color-coded status badges for quick visual assessment
  - Responsive design for both desktop and mobile
- **Usage Examples**:
  - Filter jobs by status to focus on specific workflow stages
  - Search by customer name to find client-specific jobs
  - Sort by creation date to prioritize oldest/newest jobs
  - View complete job details including location, contact info, and photo counts
- **DIFF**:
  ```diff
  + <script lang="ts">
  +   import { onMount } from 'svelte';
  +   import { getWorkshops, type WorkshopRecord } from '$lib/services/workshop';
  +   import { fade } from 'svelte/transition';
  +   import Select from 'svelte-select';
  + 
  +   let workshops: WorkshopRecord[] = [];
  +   let filteredWorkshops: WorkshopRecord[] = [];
  +   let loading = true;
  +   let error: string | null = null;
  + 
  +   // Filter states
  +   let statusFilter = '';
  +   let customerFilter = '';
  +   let sortBy = 'created_at';
  +   let sortOrder: 'asc' | 'desc' = 'desc';
  ```
- **WHY**: Workshop managers needed a centralized way to view and manage all jobs without navigating to individual pages
- **IMPACT**: Significantly improves operational efficiency by providing comprehensive job status visibility and management tools

### Files Modified:

#### 1. `src/lib/Header.svelte`
- **ADDED**: "Workshop Job Status" menu item to Workshop dropdown in both desktop and mobile navigation
- **DIFF**:
  ```diff
  + <a
  +   href="{base}/workshop/job-status"
  +   class="block px-4 py-2.5 text-gray-700 hover:bg-gray-50 hover:text-gray-900 transition-colors duration-150"
  +   on:click={() => workshopOpen = false}
  + >Workshop Job Status</a>
  ```
- **WHY**: Provides navigation access to the new Workshop Job Status page
- **IMPACT**: Makes the new feature easily accessible from the main navigation interface

### Technical Improvements:

#### Data Management:
- **BEFORE**: No centralized view of workshop jobs - required navigating to individual workshop pages
- **AFTER**: Comprehensive dashboard with all workshop data in one place

#### User Experience:
- **BEFORE**: Limited ability to filter, sort, or search workshop jobs
- **AFTER**: Advanced filtering, sorting, and search capabilities with visual indicators

#### Accessibility:
- **IMPLEMENTED**: Proper form labels and ARIA attributes for screen readers
- **FIXED**: All potential accessibility issues identified by linting tools

#### Error Handling:
- **ADDED**: Proper error state display when workshop data fails to load
- **ADDED**: Loading indicators during data fetching operations
- **ADDED**: Empty state handling when no workshops match filters

### Testing Instructions:

1. **Access the Workshop Job Status Page**:
   - Navigate to Workshop â†’ Workshop Job Status from the main menu
   - Verify the page loads with workshop data in a table format

2. **Test Filtering Capabilities**:
   - Filter by status using the dropdown (try each status option)
   - Search for a customer by typing in the customer filter field
   - Verify results update correctly for each filter combination

3. **Test Sorting Functionality**:
   - Click column headers to sort (Created, Customer, Product, Work Order, Status)
   - Verify sort direction toggles between ascending and descending
   - Check that sort indicators (arrows) appear correctly

4. **Test Responsive Design**:
   - View the page on different screen sizes
   - Verify table remains usable on mobile devices with horizontal scrolling
   - Test mobile navigation to ensure the new menu item works correctly

### Routes Added:
- **Client Route**: `/workshop/job-status` (protected route)

### Related Components:
- Workshop service functions (`getWorkshops()`, `WorkshopRecord` interface)
- Header navigation component
- Existing workshop management workflow

### Dependencies:
- Uses existing components: Svelte Select, fade transition
- No new external dependencies added

### Performance Considerations:
- Efficient client-side filtering and sorting to minimize server requests
- Reactive data handling to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Pagination considerations for future implementation if workshop data grows significantly
